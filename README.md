## Introduction
We saw that Smoothie King’s current server UI, manager side inventory management & user interaction model costs them customers. Accordingly, our (Group 22’s) proposed solution addresses all the above concerns by providing a streamlined order process for customers and a streamlined POS interface for servers, a menu board for showcasing items in the restaurant, a wide number of manager tools for keeping things running, reliable systems and more ways to order so that lines are never too busy!
